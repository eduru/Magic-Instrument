## About Magic Instrument

I'm an Apple fanboy so I wanted to try to develop an iOS application during poliglotal week at Code Chrysalis.
I developed the app using Xcode and Swift.

### The goal of the application

It doesn't matter that you haven't played any instrument before. The app is built in a way that all the notes you play will
sound correctly. Just enjoy the instrument and dance along the chiken!

### Features

- A chicken who is going to dance while you play the music.
- Play and stop buttons to initiate the music loop.
- Three buttons to play music. Each one has a different timber and quality of sound. They have also asotiated different music notes that match the key of the background music loop.
